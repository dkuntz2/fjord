    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/dkuntz2/fjord">fjord</a> 
      is a static-site generator, written in Python, based on
      <a href="http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com">mynt</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people would probably be better off using mynt at this point, simply
      because all this does is add some new features that I wanted, and didn't
      really care if they were accepted into the main mynt branch or not. If
      you're not someone who wants a more stable version, and might like some
      of the tweaks I've made, you might like this.
    </p>

    <h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

    <p>
      Currently, fjord has two differences from mynt:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The global <code>tags</code> variable is sorted alphabetically, not
        by original occurance.
      </li>

      <li>
        Posts now have a <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> variable, which
        hold the next and previous post's data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>
      fjord can be installed in two ways, using <code>pip</code> or manually.
    </p>

    <h3>Using pip</h3>

    <p>
      Just run<br>
      <code># pip install git+https://github.com/dkuntz2/fjord.git</code>
    </p>


    <h3>Manually</h3>

    <p>
      Download the fjord repository, and run 
      <code>$ python2 setup.py build</code> to build it, and <br>
      <code># python2 setup.py install</code> to install it. You should now
      be able to use the <code>fjord</code> command.
    </p>

    <h2 id="using">Using</h2>

    <p>
      I currently don't have any unique documentation for fjord (at some point
      in the future I might), and suggest checking out
      <a href="http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com/docs/">mynt's documentation</a> for
      getting started.
