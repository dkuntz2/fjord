      fjord is an easy to use blog-aware static-site generator
    </h2>
    <hr class="notop">

    <p>
      fjord is a blog-aware static-site generator written in python. fjord
      offers users a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>-like experience,
      but is written in python, for those of us who don't like ruby.
    </p>

    <p>
      fjord is based off of <a href="http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com">mynt</a>,
      but includes a few additions and modifications. If you're already running
      a mynt-based site, switching to fjord is as easy as changing your commands
      from <code>mynt</code> to <code>fjord</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>More Static-Site Generation?</h2>

    <p>
      Sure, there are tons of static-site generators out there already, and a
      few of them are written in python, just like the parent of fjord, but
      what's wrong with adding another one to the fold?
    </p>

    <p>
      fjord exists in the spirit of open-source software, if you don't like how
      something works, make it work the way you want it to.
    </p>

    <h2>What's Different?</h2>

    <p>
      If you want an overview of the main features of fjord, you should check
      out the <a href="http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com/docs/">mynt docs</a>. If,
      after reading the differences list, you don't think you'll use the
      differences, I suggest using mynt.
    </p>

    <p>There are four key differences between fjord and mynt:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Posts have two additional variables, <code>post.prev</code> and 
          <code>post.next</code>, which contain the title and url of the
          previous and next posts, which makes it easier to paginate your blog.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The global <code>tags</code> variable is sorted alphabetically in 
          fjord. In mynt, it's sorted by the tag's original ocurrance.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Post titles are forced to be strings. Nothing wild, but it's due to
          how I have my system setup.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The default <a href="http://misaka.61924.nl/">Misaka</a> (fjord and
          mynt's default markdown rendering engine) flags have been changed a
          little. Superscript, tables, and header links have been enabled, and
          hard_wrap has been disabled.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
      fjord has two installation options, using pip or installing it from the
      source, which is essentially the same thing as using pip in this instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because fjord is currently under development, it is not in the PyPI, but
      it can still be installed with pip, just run
    </p>

    <pre><code># pip install git+https://github.com/dkuntz2/fjord.git</code></pre>

    <p>
      Alternatively, if you want to install it from the source, you can download
      the fjord repository, and run 
      <pre><code>$ ./make.sh</code></pre>
    </p>
